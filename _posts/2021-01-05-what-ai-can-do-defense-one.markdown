title:  What AI Can and Cannot do for the IC

My colleague [John Speed Meyers](https://www.linkedin.com/in/john-speed-meyers-66b6a740/) and I published a short 
[thought-piece](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2021/01/what-ai-can-and-cannot-do-intelligence-community/171195/)
in DefenseOne!
Here, we set some realistic expectations for how artificial intelligence can be used in the work of IC professionals.
The key takeaways are:
- AI can help with 'thinking fast' tasks
- AI will have trouble with deliberative, 'thinking slow' tasks

We outline how current AI methods are useful for offloading rapid data assessment tasks (like object identification and classification in imagery),
but they simply are not quite ready for planning and communicating more abstract ideas necessary for deliberative judgement.
Basically, seasoned IC analysts are in no danger of being replaced by general AI, but machine learning can serve as an empowering tool.
Hope you enjoy!
