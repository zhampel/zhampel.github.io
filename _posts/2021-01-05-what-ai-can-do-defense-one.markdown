title:  What AI Can and Cannot do for the IC
mathjax: true

My colleague John Speed Meyers and I published a short 
[thought-piece](https://www.defenseone.com/ideas/2021/01/what-ai-can-and-cannot-do-intelligence-community/171195/)
in DefenseOne!
Here, we set some realistic expectations for how artificial intelligence can be used in the work of IC professionals.
The key takeaways are:
- AI can help with 'thinking fast' tasks
- AI will have trouble with deliberative, 'thinking slow' tasks
Basically, we outline how current AI methods are useful for offloading rapid data assessment tasks like object identification and classification in imagery,
but they simply are not quite ready to take planning and communicating the abstract ideas necessary for deliberative judgement.
Hope you enjoy!
