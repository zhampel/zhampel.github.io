title:  DeepFake Detection Challenge

In two recently published blog posts, my colleague [Michael Lomnitz](https://www.linkedin.com/in/michael-r-lomnitz/)
and I discuss IQTLabs's work in FaceBook's DeepFake Detection Challenge ([DFDC](https://ai.facebook.com/datasets/dfdc/)).

In the [first post](https://www.iqt.org/deepfake-detection-challenge/), we outline the deepfake problem,
the crowd-sourcing approach of the challenge itself, and set the stage for results.
The [second post](https://www.iqt.org/deepfake-detection-challenge-pt-ii/) goes in depth on the steps for
using the dataset, the models trained for deepfake detection, and finally a comparative analysis of the results.

Ultimately, the highest performing submissions were those that relied heavily on the choice of data augmentation methods
rather than implementing the latest and greatest model architecture.
And despite the small team, the IQTLabs solution landed in the top 28% of challenge submissions.
Hope you enjoy!
